### Challenge 1: SHOW EM UP

Make the ingredient buttons pop up based on their current active state. This would help customers identify what ingredients they've selected and what's left out.

### Challenge 2: TAKE THE ORDER

Show the customer only the ingredients that they've selected on the chalk board.
